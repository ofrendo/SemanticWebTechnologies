\section{Application domain and goals}
The goal of this application is to allow a user browsing websites to automatically retrieve additional information about entities in a given text. The information should be presented to the user in a way that is easily consumable. 

As such this application targets any user that is interested in supplementary information while browsing. By automating the process of looking up entities the user saves time as he does not have to manually visit other websites such as Wikipedia. 

In addition, the application searches for information in many sources. This way the information does not stem from any one source but is the union of several sources.  During search the application retrieves only certain attributes. These attributes can be customized by the user, thus allowing him to decide which information should be retrieved. This application will focus on English input to simplify processing.
