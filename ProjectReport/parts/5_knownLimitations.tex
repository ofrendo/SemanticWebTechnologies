\section{Known limitations}
In which domains does the application not work? 
- other languages



Are there queries which cannot be answered? â€“ Why? 
- queries with too many entities (i.e. long text): waiting time very high
- memory limitations






How could you overcome those limitations, given more time?
- Cache commonly requested entities locally (in a TBA)
- Another limitation: self signed certificate. Given more time: Instead of running the server locally, host the server on the internet and set up a domain redirecting to the IP adress of the server and buying/setting up a secure certificate for the domain


We could mention papers describing techniques which could improve certain areas like LINDA \cite{boehm_linda:_2012} for entity matching.
