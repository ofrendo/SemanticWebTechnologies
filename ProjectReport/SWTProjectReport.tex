\section{Requirements of report}
• 10-12 pages (sharp!) without title and toc pages 
• due Friday, December 2nd, 23:59 
• send by email to Anna Lisa, André and Heiko 
• describe your solution including the steps to get there: 
1. Application domain and goals 
Which users are targeted? – Which user problems are solved? – Which user information needs are addressed
2. Datasets used 
 Which datasets does the application use? – How are they accessed (SPARQL, local)? – How do you combine information from different datasets? 
3. Techniques used 
Reasoning – Search – external services
4. Example results 
 What outcomes does the application provide? – How is are some user queries answered? 
5. Known limitations 
– In which domains does the application not work? – Are there queries which cannot be answered? – Why? – How could you overcome those limitations, given more time?
6. Lessons learned 
– Which challenges did you face? – What were the biggest obstacles? – What would you do differently next time?

Requirements 
You must use the DWS master thesis layout
Please cite sources properly. Preferred citation style [Author, year]

%References
%Add own references in .bib file


\section{Kown limitations}
We could mention papers describing techniques which could improve certain areas like LINDA\cite{boehm_linda:_2012} for entity matching.
